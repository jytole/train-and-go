# train-and-go
The GitHub repository for the Mississippi State University Senior Design Project entitled Train and Go. Missing files from /website/ can be retrieved upon request by Kyler Smith.

The majority of the files are organized into arduino projects, which require their own folders that have a name that matches the file name.

This project has been completed and won the Senior Design competition! This repository has been archived.
